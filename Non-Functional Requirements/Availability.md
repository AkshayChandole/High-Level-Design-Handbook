# What is Availability?

Availability is the percentage of time a service or infrastructure is accessible and functional under normal conditions. A service with **100% availability** operates correctly at all times.

## Measuring Availability

Mathematically, availability **A** is a ratio where a higher value indicates better reliability. It is calculated using the following formula:

$$
A\ (\%) = \frac{\text{Total Time} - \text{Amount Of Time Service Was Down}}{\text{Total Time}} \times 100
$$

Availability is typically measured in **"nines."** The table below illustrates the permitted downtime for various availability tiers:

### The Nines of Availability

*Availability Percentages vs. Service Downtime*

| Availability % | Downtime per Year | Downtime per Month | Downtime per Week |
|---|---|---|---|
| 90% (1 nine) | 36.5 days | 72 hours | 16.8 hours |
| 99% (2 nines) | 3.65 days | 7.20 hours | 1.68 hours |
| 99.5% (2 nines) | 1.83 days | 3.60 hours | 50.4 minutes |
| 99.9% (3 nines) | 8.76 hours | 43.8 minutes | 10.1 minutes |
| 99.99% (4 nines) | 52.56 minutes | 4.32 minutes | 1.01 minutes |
| 99.999% (5 nines) | 5.26 minutes | 25.9 seconds | 6.05 seconds |
| 99.9999% (6 nines) | 31.5 seconds | 2.59 seconds | 0.605 seconds |
| 99.99999% (7 nines) | 3.15 seconds | 0.259 seconds | 0.0605 seconds |

## Availability and Service Providers

Service providers calculate availability differently. It is crucial to understand specific calculation methods, as they often exclude certain events:

- Measurement start times (e.g., service launch vs. client usage start).
- Partial outages affecting only a subset of clients.
- Planned maintenance windows.
- Downtime caused by cyberattacks.

Therefore, we should carefully understand how a specific provider calculates their availability numbers.
